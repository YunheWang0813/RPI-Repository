   the word is at least 8 characters long, starts with a vowel, 
   alternates vowels and consonants and the consonants are in 
   increasing alphabetical order.

######### Put all your function definitions here

######## This is the main body of your program
######## All code should be below the if statement

######## This if statement is executed when we run the program
######## but not when we import it as a module

#######  Keep the body of your program small, put main
#######  functions in a function, but each function should do
#######  something simple

if __name__ == "__main__":
    word = raw_input("Enter a word => ")
    print word

    ## now call your function here and check its output
